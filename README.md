# About
A drop-in PCB replacement for Kinesis Advantage2 keyboard for QMK firmware.

Based on the work from Stapelberg and Wunsch. What I have done is updating the thumb clusters connectors on the board. No more desoldering for the thumb clusters anymore on the Advantage2 keyboard. Just plug the connectors on the new board and you are ready to go for QMK firmware. If you want to revert it back, just replace the original PCB.

# Credits

Thanks to Stapelberg and Wunsch for their original work on the board for Advantage keyboard.
